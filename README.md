# Heartbeat classification via CNN, multilayer perceptrons and focal loss
1, Dataset\
---  ECG signal is sampled at 250 Hz\
---  There are 61885 heartbeats & normal:61470, others:415\
---  The file "main" is training result we do\
---  If you want to using the model to predict new waves, please go to the file "predict newwave"\
\
2, Modeling ECG data by using Python\
--- Python 3.6.13\
--- import keras\
--- import tensorflow\
